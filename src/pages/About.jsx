                <p>
                    I am a passionate web developer committed to crafting smooth and user-friendly digital experiences. With expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies, I combine creativity with technical skills to turn innovative concepts into reality. My journey in web development began with a curiosity about the inner workings of the websites we use daily. This intrigue led me to participate in a bootcamp where I learned languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as various frameworks. On the server side, I utilize technologies like Node.js and Express.js.
